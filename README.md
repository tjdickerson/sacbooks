# sacbooks (wip)

## What is it?
This is a simple app made to balance accounts. Made specifically for how I want to keep track of expenses.

## Why is it developed the way it is?
I wanted to experiment with a Go backend and a React front end on a project. This seemed to be a good candidate. The architecture here isn't necessarily a good way to set up a personal app.
