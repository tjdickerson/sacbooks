## What is it?
This is a simple app made balance accounts. Made specifically for how I want to keep track of things.

## Why is it developed the way it is?
I wanted to experiment with a go backend and a react front end on a project. This seemed to be a good candidate. The architecture here isn't necessarily a good way to set up a personal app.
